1. Introduction :
This mini project demonstrates the development of an AI assistant that delivers motivational messages and daily habit reminders based on the time of day. Using CrewAI's autonomous agent framework and Hugging Face’s local FLAN-T5 model, we define two intelligent agents that perform tasks dynamically according to morning, afternoon, or evening time. This project is entirely offline capable and customizable for real world productivity enhancements.
